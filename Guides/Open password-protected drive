1. Find out the type of encryption:
    file -s [path]
    or blkid
2. Identify the drive (probably do this first)
    lsblk
3. Open the drive:
    sudo cryptsetup luksOpen [path] # LUKS drive encryption
4. Find the decrypted drive:
    ls /dev/mapper/
5. Mount it:
    sudo mount /dev/mapper/[drive]
