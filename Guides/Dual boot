1. Download and burn a iso to usb via Rufus if Windows
# This should be a single boot usb
# As using multi-boot would later result in errors
# It works but troublesome later on for some reasons
# When booting for Thinkpad/Omen
2. For windows, log in and use advanced startup.
3. Select usb boot option (can be hidden at the last page)
4. Proceed with linux installation
---------------------------------------
# As of today, the grub boot load menu still cannot detect Windows 
# Need to go for UEFI menu to boot in Windows if needed
