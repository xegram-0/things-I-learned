Good stuff:
1. The most out of the box distro ever (highly important)
2. Offer mix themes to customize your light side and dark side
3. Already have ibus for telex Vietnamese keyboard
4. You can download deb package and install it via package installer right away without extra steps
5. Able to switch gtx and amd flawlessly

Bad stuff:
1. Steam not working for some reasons - Crashed everytime (fixed by install from the steam site and type steam in terminal to download stuff)
2. Libre office icons were not visible in light mode, dark mode looked good but not enough (fixed by changing the theme icons)
3. Grub could not detect windows 11 and be useless for having it at the startup (tried but nothing worked)
4. The GPU driver was not installed (fixed by adding PPA link for drivers, installing the latest one and then rebooting the system)
5. Hakuneko is not functional. 
6. USB crashed twice in a row with drive being used despite being ejected.
7. Chance of having wifi card turned off now appeared. 
# Turn on and off with shutdown command
