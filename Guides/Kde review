1. Customizable is much bigger than other DEs except archlinux
2. Might be intimidating as first but get easier once knowing all the options

The bad:
1. Not as lightweight as I thought
2. Constant crash on the theme shops
3. Despite being highly customizable, things can get
4. Buggy and out of place
5. This de can get too hot
6. The shop is slow
