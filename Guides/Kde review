The good:
1. Customizable is much bigger than other DEs except archlinux
2. Might be intimidating as first but get easier once knowing all the options
3. The ecosystem is good enough

The bad:
1. Not as lightweight as I thought
2. Constant crash on the theme shops
3. Despite being highly customizable, things can get
4. Buggy and out of place
5. This de can get too hot
6. The shop is slow


# I may like the default of this distro a lot more
# the shop loads faster
# kde can cap laptop battery 
# elisa as music player is amazing
# it is arch based distro
# high maintenance is a myth
# for some reasons my firefox is lagging when
# watching yt
# you need a partition manager for kde
# unmount then lock then proceed like usual
# seem like yt is slow on firefox
# the downloading on firefox would appear on the
# screen rather than the browser
# you have to hit apply when install or upgrade
when using the software update
# download xp drive from their site then use 
# bash to install the .sh file
