The good:
1. Customizable is much bigger than other DEs except archlinux
2. Might be intimidating as first but get easier once knowing all the options
3. The ecosystem is good enough
4. Kde set battery cap level
5. Elisa music player is really good
The bad:
1. Not as lightweight as I thought
2. Constant crash on the theme shops
3. Despite being highly customizable, things can get
4. Buggy and out of place
5. This de can get too hot
6. The shop is slow
7. Partition manager is a must

# I may like the default of this distro a lot more
# the shop loads faster
# it is arch based distro
# high maintenance is a myth
# the downloading on firefox would appear on the
# screen rather than the browser
# you have to hit apply when install or upgrade
when using the software update
# download xp drive from their site then use 
# bash to install the .sh file
