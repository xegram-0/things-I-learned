"To install it, I suggest you to move the folder to /opt/ by running

sudo mv ~/Downloads/RoKiSim/ /opt/

to make the program executable by running

chmod +x /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim

and to add a symbolic link to /usr/bin/ by running

sudo ln -s /opt/RoKiSim/bin/RoKiSim /usr/bin/rokisim

After that, you'll be able to run the program just by running rokisim."
