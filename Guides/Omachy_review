Good things:
1. A out-of-the-box OS
2. Lightining fast with pacman and snappy when doing dev work
3. Lightning fast with installation and everything else such as remove or reinstall
4. Sleek as heck and very cool in terms of design and style
Need improvements:
1. The clock does not show seconds by defaults
2. Cannot play game
