Good stuff:
1. Look very sleek compared to fedora or other gnome from the start
2. Everything is just well functional
3. Usuak gnome default theme is quite boring but not this one
4. Stable as a tree
5. Snap window from one workplace to another without complicating steps
Not so happy:
1. At first, it kept getting wifi disconnected and asked for connection instead of reconnecting
2. When downloading from app store, it did not appear to be downloading after hitting install button
3. Resouce consumption is higher than others
4. Boot time is longer than usual, but zorin might do a bit better
5. Sometimes it is boring
6. Unknown icons might be annoying
