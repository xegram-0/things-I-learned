Good stuff:
1. Look very sleek compared to fedora or other gnome from the start
2. Everything is just well functional
Not so happy:
1. At first, it kept getting wifi disconnected and asked for connection instead of reconnecting
2. When downloading from app store, it did not appear to be downloading after hitting install button
