Based on this guide: https://immich.app/docs/install/docker-compose/
1. Follow the link guide
2. Check out the place to store and upload files before activating docker
    UPLOAD_LOCATION=./library
    LOCATION=./postgres
3. Update time zone
    # TZ=Etc/UTC
4. Change the default password
    DB_PASSWORD=postgres
5. In docker-compose.yml, update whatever picture folders needed on the cloud at volumes
    - ${UPLOAD_LOCATION}:/usr/src/app/upload
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
6. Start up docker
    sudo docker compose up -d

In case of updating changes if either yml and .env is configured after running docker:
    sudo docker compose down
then
    sudo docker compose up -d
after that check if the server is in constant restart
    sudo docker ps
if it is the case, double check the yml and .env, highly it is a misconfiguration
