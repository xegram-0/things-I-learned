# Whatever guides online, they just do not work until this:

1. Get in bluetoothctl
2. Remove the device based on MAC adddress
3. Power off
4. Agent KeyboardDisplay
5. default-Agent
6. power on
7. scan on
8. trust -> pair -> connect

# Totally failure: Keyboard
# Only the controller, mouse and headphone are good to go without disconnecting

# For controller, proceed with all the step above
# Model Gulikit Controller XW
# Set it to windows mode and connect like usual

# Mouse and headphone is straight forward with bit of tinkling for headphone audio
