Default apps:
    Libre Wolf (now that firefox is not good)
    Transmission (it is default for many distro and did its job)
    VSCodium
    Thunar/Nautilus is much preferable (dolphin is not smoothly enough)
    Konsole (or any terminal that offers green on black theme with transparent toggle)
    Clementine (by far the best for my use) UPDATED: VLC (enable multi instance)
    Bitwarden
    Timeshift (backup)
    VLC (watch mkv files)
    Libre office
    iBus (Vietnamese typing)
		Clock
		ufw
		jetbrains stuff
    TexStudio
    Nvim Lazy Vim
Maybe:
	VirtualBox
	UnRar
	Anki
	ytDownloader
	Drawing
	Brave (as backup)
    Steam (use for windows apps or just play games)
    Wine (like above but in the terminal)
    Discord
    Draw (like PirateSoftware)
    Hakuneko (manga downloader)
    Nicotine+ (not drug, a gui soulseeker)
    Windows tiling system
    Nvidia (if I do use one has it)
    OBS
    USB writer (when distro jumping)
    Peazip (depend)
    KDE connect (not good for iphone-linux connection anymore)
