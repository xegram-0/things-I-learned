Case 1: Change name of the directory in git repo
Because github does not provide means of changing directory name, only in terminal can that happen.
git mv <old-name> <new-name>
Then the git commit and git push.

Case 2: Naming convention
Use the this-is-the-name for github naming convention.

Case 3: Move multiple files in git repo
mv dir1/file1 dir1/file2 dir2/
mv dir/* DIR/
