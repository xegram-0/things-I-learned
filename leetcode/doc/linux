# kde hates 
# not as lightweight as I thought
# constant crash on the theme shops

# does not feel snappy

# default theme is quite boring

# you need a partition manager for kde
# unmount then lock then proceed like usual
# seem like yt is slow on firefox
# the downloading on firefox would appear on the

# you have to hit apply when install or upgrade
#when using the software update
# download xp drive from their site then use

# ip v6 fix to access steam
# change dns to cloudflare dns
# for kde change auto to manual
